# Copying files and folders

## Copy a package tar.gz file

It is important to end the destination folder in the image with a slash. Like this: `/home/rstudio/pkg/`.


```
# install a package from source
COPY pkg/sbrl_1.2.tar.gz /home/rstudio/pkg/
RUN R CMD INSTALL /home/rstudio/pkg/sbrl_1.2.tar.gz
```


## Copy the current folder

```
## Copy the current directory to /analysis
COPY . /analysis
```

## Copying folders

Copy two folders to an image:

```
## Copy your working files over
## The $USER defaults to `rstudio` but you can change this at runtime
COPY ./Analysis /home/$USER/Analysis
COPY ./Data /home/$USER/Data
```


## Copy an R script to an image


```
## Copy requirements.R to container directory /tmp
COPY ./DockerConfig/requirements.R /tmp/requirements.R 
## install required libs on container
RUN Rscript /tmp/requirements.R
```

## Copy a folder from a stage image


```
# copy conky that was built from source
COPY --from=builder /opt/conky /opt/conky
```


## Copy folder using the stage number instead of the name

```
# source: https://github.com/bcicen/ctop

FROM quay.io/vektorcloud/go:1.12

RUN apk add --no-cache make

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
RUN make build && \
    mkdir -p /go/bin && \
    mv -v ctop /go/bin/

FROM scratch
ENV TERM=linux

COPY --from=0 /go/bin/ctop /ctop
ENTRYPOINT ["/ctop"]
```


## Using ADD
`ADD` is another way to copy files but it is not recommended.
Example:

```
FROM debian:testing
ADD tools/rootfs.tar.xz /
```

It will copy the folder `tools` in the host to the root folder in the container.
